# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player abstract strategy game. It's a game typically played on a 3x3 grid, consisting of nine cells arranged in three rows and three columns. The game can also be played on larger grids for variation.

Here's how the game is played:

Objective: The goal of the game is to be the first player to align three of your own symbols (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.

Setup: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid. One player is assigned the symbol "X" and the other player is assigned the symbol "O". Typically, the player using "X" goes first.

Gameplay: Players take turns marking one empty cell on the grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). A cell can only be marked once, so players must choose carefully.

Winning the Game: A player wins if they manage to place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

Tie: If the grid is filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a tie.

Variations: While the standard game is played on a 3x3 grid, larger grids (e.g., 4x4, 5x5) can be used for more complex variations of the game.

Strategic Play: The game can be quite strategic despite its simplicity. Experienced players learn to anticipate the opponent's moves and block potential winning lines.
